# Operational Principles and Security Commitments

This document defines the operational principles that guide my professional conduct, technical decisions, and the development of all projects presented in this portfolio.

---

## 1. Integrity and Technical Transparency

### Transparency of Contribution

I clearly state the extent of my involvement in each project.  
All third-party tools, open-source libraries, and external contributions are explicitly acknowledged.

### Technical Accuracy

I do not omit known limitations, architectural constraints, or unresolved issues.  
Documentation reflects both capabilities and areas requiring improvement.

---

## 2. Responsible Security Practice

### Authorization-First Approach

No security testing, simulation, or analysis is conducted without explicit authorization.

### Responsible Disclosure

Identified vulnerabilities are reported through appropriate and ethical disclosure channels.  
No sensitive findings are publicly exposed without formal consent.

### Environment Isolation

Laboratory environments are isolated and controlled.  
No testing infrastructure interacts with external systems without authorization.

---

## 3. Data Protection and Confidentiality

### Privacy by Design

Security and data protection principles are integrated from the earliest stages of development.

### Confidential Handling

Sensitive information is not stored, shared, or reused outside authorized contexts.

### Non-Disclosure Compliance

Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) are strictly respected.  
Client-related work is only presented with formal authorization.

---

## 4. Ethical Use of Automation and AI

### Human Oversight

All AI-assisted outputs are reviewed, validated, and tested before integration into security-sensitive contexts.

### Accountability

Final responsibility for technical decisions remains human.  
Automated tools support analysis but do not replace professional judgment.

### Traceability

AI-assisted processes remain auditable and traceable when applied to security workflows.

---

## 5. Professional Responsibility

### Continuous Improvement

I maintain ongoing study and technical refinement to align with current security standards and best practices.

### Standards Alignment

Where applicable, practices are aligned with recognized industry frameworks and compliance requirements.
