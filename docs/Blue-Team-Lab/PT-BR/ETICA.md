# ⚖️ Professional Code of Ethics

This document outlines the ethical principles that guide my professional practice, decision-making, and the development of the projects presented in this portfolio.

## 1. Integrity and Authorship
- **Transparency:** I commit to being honest about the extent of my involvement in each project. Credits to third parties, open-source libraries, and contributors are always explicitly stated.
- **Technical Honesty:** I do not omit known flaws or technical limitations for the sake of commercial aesthetics. I document what works and what still requires improvement.

## 2. Digital and Social Responsibility
- **Privacy by Design:** I prioritize data protection and end-user privacy in every solution I develop.
- **Anti-Dark Patterns:** I refuse to create interfaces or systems designed to deceive, manipulate, or trick users into harmful decisions.
- **Social Impact:** I do not participate in projects that promote hate speech, misinformation, or any form of systemic discrimination.

## 3. Ethical Use of Technology (AI and Automation)
- **AI-Augmented Productivity:** I actively leverage AI and automation to enhance efficiency and scale my capabilities. I view these technologies as powerful partners in the development process.
- **Human-in-the-loop (HITL):** I maintain total accountability for the final output. Every AI-assisted contribution is rigorously audited, tested, and refined to ensure it meets high security and performance standards.
- **Sustainability:** I strive to optimize algorithms and resources to reduce unnecessary processing and energy consumption.

## 4. Confidentiality
- I strictly respect Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs). Real-world client projects displayed here use dummy data or have formal authorization for public display.
